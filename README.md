# rlox

Implements a [Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html)
interpreter in Ruby.

This is a "by-the-book" implementation that aims to stick as closely as
possible to the source text (and ideally, serve as a jlox drop-in). The
interpreter itself has been adapted to be more ruby-like, where germane.
